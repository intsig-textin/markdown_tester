# Loss per share

The loss per share for continuing operations has been calculated using the loss for the year attributable to the owners of the parent of £11,301,000 (year ended January 31, 2014: loss of £6,093,000; year ended January 31, 2013: loss of £4,225,000) and dividing this by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year to January 31, 2015: 39,599,222 (year ended January 31, 2014: 20,509,631; year ended January 31, 2013: 15,809,445). The numbers of ordinary shares in issue were updated retrospectively to give effect to the share consolidation and subdivision which occurred on 3 July 2014 (Note 19).

Since the Group has reported a net loss from continuing activities, diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share.

Potentially dilutive shares capable of vesting under the share options currently in issue totalled 5,250,838 as at January 31, 2015 (January 31, 2014: 3,573,597; January 31, 2013: 2,499,213).
